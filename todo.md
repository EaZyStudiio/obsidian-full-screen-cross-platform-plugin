Simulated [V1.0 Idea](https://github.com/DonkeyPacific/obsidian-full-screen-cross-platform-plugin) / Native [prozen](https://github.com/cmoskvitin/obsidian-prozen) and [fullscreen plugin](https://github.com/Razumihin/obsidian-fullscreen-plugin)

Moble mode support with 2 and 3 clicks

Issues with themes 🥲 it's obsidian! 

Fix vertical tab fuckery

We have 2 yet 3 modes

    - 1 view mode = *2 Simulated and Nativer
    - Fullscreen as seen Mode = Simulated

Edge cases where user uses all at once 😒😒


Know issues:

    - Popup window - Don't use simulated
    - Vertical tabbar - Honestly I have no idea
    - Does not work well with any of the 3 pior plugins it aims to replace
