### !important

### What Why HOW

​    What: This plugin is basically a mix of the top 3 plugins Fullscreen plugins "might have overcomplicated things"

​    Why: 1. they haven't been updated in ages except this one

           2. NO VIM MODE SUPPORT 😭😭
              very solution sucked in there own ways

standards and only when really necessary obsidian API "Read the fun-fact"

### FunFact + more

   You might be wondering why vanilla js insted of type script, well this is actually my first obsidian plugin and by some stroke of luck i started by modifying [obsidian-fullscreen-plugin](https://github.com/Razumihin/obsidian-fullscreen-plugin/releases/tag/0.1.2) which probably is the only obsidian plugin that does not come with the esbuild comment and is just plain old js

   After about 2hrs+ of modifying the plugin with no luck battling fighting chromium to ignore the esc key when in full screenmode "which i already knew would not work" and some other fuctionalities I ended up giving up and decided to do some research and there i found [this crossplatform plugin](https://github.com/DonkeyPacific/obsidian-full-screen-cross-platform-plugin) it had a unique way of solving this issue insted of relying on Standard JavaScript & Browser/DOM APIs it uses a knock off pretty ingenious idea to mimic it but it wasn't quite there yet it needed to be complex yet fast wayyyy wayyy fast... and there i noticed the right way to make an obsidian plugin but i was to far into the weeds so i just flowed with it. how hard could it be right 😂

   Any ways considering i know for a fact as long as this plugin does not break am not fixing nothing about it I decided on A few things using Standard JavaScript & Browser/DOM APIs are a bigger piority than obsidians api this allow a higer chance of the plugin not breaking down "at least most of it" as obsidian changes over the years.

   also I mostly am just used to that side of the garden sooo. i'll say it's roughly 75% - 25% respectively
